When I arrived at my accommodation yesterday evening, I had a look at the summit of Puy de Sancy.
The youth hostel is ideally located in the valley below the summit.
I couldn't see the summit yesterday: it was hidden by thick clouds.
I hoped that the situation would improve by the morning, but it hasn't so far.

When I leave the youth hostel, the summit is still in the clouds.
I set off, hoping that it would clear by the time I get there.
I don't have much hope, but I have to comfort myself: I'm going up there anyway.

Although the summit can't be seen right now, the first part of the path that goes up to it is clearly visible from below.
The path looks easy enough, quite wide, not too steep and not technical at all.
In winter, this is probably a ski piste.

On my way up, I see large birds of prey gliding gently over the grassy slopes.
In a few pictures, they look like vultures.  
In addition to the birds, I also keep an eye on the clouds.
As I make my way up the mountain, the mist doesn't lift at all.
It's becoming increasingly clear that the rest of the climb will be done in the fog.

To be honest, I usually enjoy the first moments in thick fog.
The gradually narrowing field of vision, distant objects losing their color, then their shape, before disappearing completely, as if sinking into another world.
Then these same objects, as if recalled to our world as we approach them, detach themselves and tear themselves away from the fog to regain their colors.
I love this mystical atmosphere, where you can only distinguish shapes from shadows.

Soon enough, though, I get to feel the dampness of the fog.
Aided by the wind, it easily penetrates my clothes, chilling me to the bone.
I have to put on all my clothes to fight this weather.
Once this is done, I can only feel the damp wind on my face, but I'm no longer cold.

Leaving aside the weather conditions, the 600-meter ascent is easy and straightforward.
In fact, it's quite easy.
From the valley, neither the elevation nor the path looked difficult, but I remained wary until the end, as usual.
Generally speaking, I'd rather be pessimistic and enjoy a good surprise than hope for the best and be disappointed.
Today, I get the "good surprise" side of the coin.

Up until the last section of the summit climb, I only saw a single person on the trail.
On this last section, a few courageous trail runners are climbing to the summit.
At the summit, I meet a few other determined hikers, who have taken a more interesting route than the ski slope I followed.

Nobody stays on the summit for long.
At the same time, you can't see a thing, the fog blocking the view at 25m.
It's a pity, because the panoramic table indicates that you can normally see Puy de Dôme, where I'm from, and Puy Mary, where I'm going.
Like the others, unimpressed by the panorama, I quickly make my way back down.
Direction Super Besse, on the other side of the massif from Mont d'or.

I'm still walking through the fog, but I'm inexplicably in a great mood.
Still motivated despite the wind, the humidity and the lack of visibility, I finally exit the fog.
I stayed in it for about 2 hours.

I can now see (or at least guess) where the trail is going.
The panorama before me is one of large, gently sloping grassy slopes, without trees to speak of.
I'm glad to see that the way down isn't going to be steep, as opposed to what I thought I read on the map.
Clearly, I'm still not used to the 1/75 000 map.
In this particular case, this lack is working in my favor.

There are a lot of mountain bikers on these slopes.
I also meet an elderly couple who tell me how they also used to walk long distances when they were younger.
They tell me of walking days of up to 35 km, 1800 m ascent, in very hot temperatures (at the Reunion), or carrying the equivalent of several days of water (in the Vercors), sometimes climbing peaks over 3000 m (in the Parc des Écrins).
My small sense of achievement built up so far is reduced to almost nothing.

Lunch break happens at Super Besse.
With a galette, a crêpe and a _bolée_ of cider in my belly, I'm back on the road. 

Unsurprisingly, once I pass the city and leave the summit and the ski resort a few kilometers behind me, I don't meet anyone on the trail.
They are replaced in much larger numbers by cows.
The trail reaches to a first chapel, which I can only access by walking through a herd of Salers cows.
They're quiet, but they look at me the whole time.
They don't seem as used to seeing hikers as Swiss cows.
As I approach, many of them stop grazing to observe me.
They only return to their main activity once I'm at a safe distance again.
I may be serene, but I remain vigilant.
Especially as the bull, although not overly interested in me, is very imposing.

After the chapel, the path follows a countryside road which winds its way through "cow fields".
As I make my way along, a few birds of prey, which before my arrival had been resting on the posts separating the fields, take their flight, visibly disturbed by my presence. 

Further on, past a fence, I enter a peat bog.
The environment is charming, quite different from the other ecosystems I've crossed so far.
The path is laid out with planks and small bridges, to avoid sinking into the mud and water streams.
But that's not where the difficulty truly lies.
It lies in the domesticated "fauna".

I have to cross another herd of cows.
The particularity here is that I really can't to go around them.
The large ruminants stand exactly on the path.
This usually requires deviating from the trail to get around the herd.
However, in the peat bog, I can't leave the marked path without ending up in calf-deep water.
I must cross the herd, very close to the animals.
I'm really cautious for several reasons.

Firstly, like the other cows I came across today, these animals stop grazing at my approach, turn towards me and glare.
I don't yet know whether this attitude is specfic to the Salers breed, or whether it's due to the fact that these hiking trails are most likely much less frequented than in Switzerland.
With this attitude, which I'm not familiar with, I'm not sure what to expect in terms of reaction from the animals. 

Secondly, the presence of calves.
They are somehow more curious than their mothers, but also more easily frightened.
Their reactions are even less predictable than those of the cows.
After observing me for some time from a distance, the calves always come closer.
Then, if I do anything that seems sudden or unpredictable, even a step in a different direction, they panic.
They start running away, jumping, howling.
These disproportionate reactions don't reassure me, because I don't really know how mothers interpret them. 

Last but not least, I still don't know where the bull is.
I'd rather know where he is so I know how he feels about me, and so I can keep him constantly in my field of vision.
When I find him, he's on my left, perfectly peaceful.
He's lying on the grass and doesn't seem the least interested in me.
In the end, crossing the herd goes well, no problems. 

The path eventually follows the departmental road.
I regularly glance back to watch the summit I climbed this morning slowly fade away into the distance.
The road takes me to Lac Chauvet.
This lake would seem completely generic if it weren't for a sign explaining that it is of volcanic origin.
According to the sign, it's a maar, _"i.e. a vast explosion crater, born of the contact between water and magma.
As the lava rose, it encountered a water table, lake or river, triggering a thermal shock that led to explosive activity.
Like all maars in Auvergne, Lac Chauvet is circular in shape, small in surface area (53 hectares) and, above all, very deep: 73 metres."_

I continue to walk, seeing the cows' coats gradually lighten towards those of the Aubrac race, as the Sancy massif shrinks further into the distance.
I spend some time observing the behavior of the herds from afar.
Like most farm animals, these cows are gregarious.
Nevertheless, they all have their own character.
It's easy to identify those who, as soon as a gate opens, venture into the new space, and those who, more cautious, wait until the majority of the herd has passed through before venturing in.

<p style="color:gray;" align="center"> <i> The Puy de Sancy (in the middle) already seems so far away... </i> </p>

The trail also takes me through farm hamlets comprised of less than a dozen buildings.
It's hard to distinguish between those that are still in use for part of the year and those that have been completely abandoned.

A bit later, the path is blocked from left to right by a flock of sheep.
The shepherd, at the rear of the flock, leads them forward by the sound of his voice, only using monosyllables.
Fortunately, they're heading in the same direction as me.
The dogs wander left and right, passing under the fences of the various meadows, but always return to their post when necessary.
I leave them as I take a path to the left that leads me to the gîte d'étape at Égliseneuve-d'Entraigues.

I'll be the only one sleeping at the gîte tonight.
This allows me to plan the next day's route in perfect calm, and to read my book before falling profoundly asleep.
