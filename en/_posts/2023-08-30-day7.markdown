Today is the big day.
Even if it's not the last day of the trip, it's the one where I reach my goal, the day I reach the summit that is the reason I undertook this whole adventure: the Plomb du Cantal.  
Highly motivated by this prospect, I start climbing as soon as I'm done with the copious breakfast at the gîte.

The summits of Puy Mary and Plomb du Cantal are not so far apart: less than 10 km apart in a straight line.
On foot, however, the distances always seem much longer.
The Super Lioran resort lies right between the two peaks, but also well below them.
This means that, even if it's only a short distance standing between me and the final summit, it's almost all uphill.
That's 725 metres of ascent to be precise.

As I climb the grassy slopes, the sun also tenaciously climbs the space in the sky that separates it from its zenith.
At some point, it slowly rises over the mountains in front of me.
Unfortunately, I'm in a wooded area when this happens, which prevents me from fully enjoying the spectacle.
I still manage to take a few decent photos.

As I leave this wooded section, I realize that I'll finally be able to enjoy a nice morning.
It's a beautiful sunny day, occasionally hidden by a cloud or two, but nothing like the overbearing fog of the previous mornings.
I can already see the ultimate summit, which I should reach momentarily.
Turning around to look at Puy Mary, where I was yesterday, I realize that it seems to be blocking the clouds.
If the clouds are constantly coming from its direction, this could explain the weather over the last few days, as well as today's.
It could be that the clouds coming from the north are stopped by this first real obstacle, constantly covering the area to the north, where I came from.
As I continue to watch the clouds, I also observe that they are moving towards the Plomb.
I shouldn't waste time if I want to see anything when I get up there.

As I start walking again, a loud thud immediately stops me in my tracks.
Ahead of me, I see 2 female deers trotting along the path, in the same direction as me.
I might not have noticed them had they not made so much noise when I inadvertently got closer.
I probably startled them.
At this time, they're most likely not too bothered on other days.
I haven't met anyone so far.

After taking a few photos and waiting a few minutes, the 2 guest stars of the morning really don't seem inclined to stray from the trail on their own.
I can't stay here all day either, so I decide to keep going, at the risk of startling them again.
As I move forward, they remain on the move to keep some distance between them and me.
I think this is a good sign.
I believe that wild animals should always remain vigilant when humans are around, and should never get completely accustomed to our presence.
As they keep moving along the path, always in the same direction as me, this dance lasts a few minutes.
Probably passably annoyed, they end up turning left and run down the slope at an incredible speed until they reach the forest below.
Once they're gone, I can admire the sea of clouds that now stretches across the foot of the Plomb du Cantal.

I keep climbing and eventually reach a first summit.
I check the map to make sure it's not yet the Plomb du Cantal: it isn't.
It's the Puy du Rocher, an intermediate summit.
From here, I can observe the falcons flying around the rocky summit.
I also have a clear view of my real objective, which doesn't seem much higher than where I stand right now.

As I approach the coveted summit, I start to distinguish silhouettes and voices.
History repeats itself.
I've had no company all morning, but it'll be crowded at the point of interest.
No doubt I'll find myself alone once I pass the parking lot (spoiler alert).

The final meters to get to the top are quite fun.
Steps have been installed, forming a spiral up to the summit.
It really looks like a scene from a movie or video game: the epic arrival to the final boss.
But here, there is no opponent.
To reach the top is to triumph.

At the top, I have the satisfying sensation of having achieved my goal, despite the effort required.
It's quite exhilarating.
A kind of euphoria that remembers the struggle.
It was hard, but I did it.

Once the emotional wave has passed, I start to contemplate the landscape.
The difference between the north and south sides is striking.
To the north, where I'm coming from, the mountains overlap and clash, carving up the landscape and the sky.
Puy Mary, perfectly visible in the foreground, keeps snagging the clouds.
Fun fact: the peaks of Puy Mary and Plomb du Cantal were part of the crater of Europe's largest volcano millions of years ago.
Given the distance separating the 2 peaks today, the crater must indeed have been gigantic.

To the south, elevation disappears almost immediately from the foot of the Plomb, giving way to a plain blending the light green of meadows and the dark green of forests.
These colors are painted all the way to the horizon, where the earth seems to rise up to prevent the plain from touching the sky.
This barrier at the edge of my field of vision, barely distinguishable from here, seems to be the Cévennes.

This immense flat expanse seems to bear no trace of human life.
No matter how long I look, I can't see a single village or house.
It's impossible to see the village of Paulhac, where I'll sleep tonight, nor Saint-Flour, where I'll sleep tomorrow.
I can guess their direction and distance using my map, but from here, nothing seems to be there.

To the west, the rock formation to which the Plomb belongs continues.
It forms a long ridge with beautiful grassy slopes.
The path leading off in this direction constantly oscillates between the two sides of the ridge.
This particular image is what matches best what I had in mind, at least before coming here, when thinking about the Massif Central.

All goal the Plomb du Cantal was to me, it isn't yet the end of my journey.
I now have to keep walking to reach Saint-Flour tomorrow, and return to civilization.
This begins with climbing down this majestic summit, reached through so much effort.

After the descent, I sit down at the pass restaurant.
Only one is open here.
I'm lucky that they still have room for me, as I still have nothing left to eat in my backplace, and the place is quite packed.

I just ordered when the person in charge of tonight's accommodation calls me, telling me that he won't be cooking dinner tonight, even though I reserved it in advance.
Apparently, no one else in the accommodation asked for it tonight, and "it's not worth it for one person", as he puts it.

This complicates things.
I'm not carrying any food anymore, and I won't be passing through any villages on the way this afternoon.
My arrival in Paulhac will probably be too late for a grocery store to be open, if there is one in the village at all.
These thoughts flew through my mind so quickly that I didn't realize my interlocutor was still talking to me.
He tells me that, in such cases, they always propose an alternative, considering the limited options offered in these lands.
One of these options is even to lend me his car so that I can get something to eat in a neighboring village.
He also points out that there's a mini-market in the village, open quite late.
That'll be enough for me to eat tonight and lunch tomorrow.
Stress peak: over.

Once lunch is over, I start walking again.
As expected, I don't meet anyone on the trail once I pass the parking lot.
The landscape around me returns to being large grassy spaces populated by a few cows.
It's a bit like the Limon plateau of the previous days, except that behind the hills in the foreground, the horizon is perfectly flat.
The total lack of people, combined with the homogeneity of the landscape and the loss of purpose, now accomplished, make the way to Paulhac quite bland.

I can't help looking back at the Plomb from time to time, with what already seems to be a slight sense of nostalgia.
