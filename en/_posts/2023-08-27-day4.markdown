Similarly to yesterday, I start walking in a very cloudy weather.
The scenery is the same as yesterday afternoon, and so are the animals.
I haven't come across a single hiker on the trail since the Puy de Sancy.
The walk is rather robotic; climbing hills, crossing fences.
And always alone.

Soon after leaving Égliseneuve-d'Entraigues, I entered the Cantal _département_.
The difference is noticeable, especially when it comes to trail marking.
The white and red markers that tell me I'm on the right path are becoming increasingly rare.
In addition to the crossroads, the "straight ahead" markers are moving further apart, and are now scattered every 250 to 500 metres.

This lack of marking leads to me getting lost for the first time.
As I walk along a very high fence, which I look to be set to follow for a long while, the markings gradually disappear.
I haven't seen any for maybe half an hour.
When I stop to look at the map, it doesn't indicate anything in particular in this area.
As I continue a little further, it becomes increasingly clear that I'm on the wrong path, as the topology of the terrain doesn't correspond at all to what I'm reading on the map.
I even use the joker of the GPS map, but can't quite figure out where I am.
After about ten minutes of confusion, walking with my phone in hand, I finally understand that I accidentally started a loop that is basically taking me back the way I came. 
I simply missed a left turn that should have had me cross the big fence.
Without GPS, _i.e._ only with the paper map, even at 1:25000, I'd probably have had a hard time finding my way back here.

After walking in the tall grass all morning, my shoes are soaked with dew.
In fact, the moisture has started to seep through my shoes and into my socks.
My feet are slowly getting wet.
The lack of sunshine doesn't allow the shoes to dry.
And now that my socks are wet, I have no hope of the inside drying out.

At lunchtime, with the help of a couple of openings in the clouds, I try to dry everything out with the help of the sun's weak rays.
The risk is that if the sun isn't strong enough, I'll have to put my wet, cold socks back on.
Fortunately, the few sun rays filtering through the clouds are enough to dry out everything over my break.
After that, all is well in the afternoon.

The GR route passes through the town of Condat.
I hesitated to extend the morning's walk in order to eat lunch here.
Good thing I didn't push myself and stopped earlier, even if I had to make a dent in my food reserves.
The town seems to be focused around the main street, which I walk along end to end.
There doesn't seem to be a single restaurant or fast food open.
There are a few bars, but only a few of that few are open right now.
Most other shops are closed, the premises completely emptied with "for sale" or "for rent" signs that don't look new.
Only the presence of the sun prevents this scene from being totally desparate.

Today's elevation is all happening around Condat.
The start and finish towns of today's walk are both high up (1000m), while Condat is in the valley, 250m below.
Now that I've come down to Condat, I have to climb back up to Lugarde.
I hesitate between taking a break before or after the climb.
I opt to start with the climb to cover more distance.
I'm pretty confident, given my current level of fatigue.
At this point, I make a comment to myself about my overall fatigue.

Basically, after the first two days, I didn't have any major problems with fatigue.
At least not enough to make me doubt whether I'll make it to the end.
I feel the weight of my bag much less than on the first day, for example.
Maybe it's due to the fact that I've already eaten some of my food, which makes the bag a little lighter.
But I think the most important thing is how I fill my bag.

The first few days, I filled my bag as I had done on previous trips.
That is to say, by putting objects more or less deeply into the bag according to two criteria: weight and usefulness.
The heaviest items go at the bottom (ideally close to the back), and the lightest go on top or "outwards" (i.e. away from the back).
However, the heavier objects I was likely to use during the day tended to remain at the top.
Consequently, lighter objects that were less useful during the day tended to migrate to the back.  
I wasn't very strict about how I filled my backpack either.
Objects taken out of the bag during the day or put back in at the last minute in the morning (e.g. toiletries or flip-flops) stayed at the top for the day, to avoid having to take everything out and then back in again.

This suboptimal management of my backpack had a tendency to make it unbalanced, with a significant proportion of the weight ending up at the top.
This increased the stress on my shoulders (my shoulders would carry more weight) and made it unpleasant to carry (the top of the bag was swinging slightly as I walked).
I strongly suspect that this bad habit had a lot to do with my extreme fatigue on the first day.

I have to credit my sister Inès for this stricter application of the basics.
I called her on the second day, when I took the bus to Mont-Dore.
She reiterated to me good backpack-filling practices to combat fatigue, i.e. focus only on the weight of the objects (to be precise, their density), and ignore the "utility" aspect.
Since the third day, I've followed this advice strictly.
It's obviously less practical, as I regularly have to take out a lot of stuff (sometimes almost everything) to find something, for example the food pack for lunch (which is very heavy, so at the bottom).
However, the gain in comfort while walking is huge.
It's worth far more than the inconvenience caused.
The latter also makes short breaks to take something out / put something away less pleasant, and therefore less frequent, which also means that I can cover more distance.  
Morale of the story: when in doubt, go back to the basics.

As I approach Lugarde, I hear something in the distance.
I'm a bit curious, so I concentrate to try and find where this is coming from.
Is it a voice I'm hearing?
If so, it seems amplified by a megaphone.
Can this be a political rally?
It would be very unexpected around here.
An announcement to the population?
Given my isolation from civilization over the last few days, something serious could have happened and I would really not know about it...

As I approach the village, it sounds more like music.
It's way too loud to be coming from something private though.
It sounds like a circus, or some kind of fair.
I get ready to go around such an event.

When I arrive in the village, I really try to avoid the event, and search for my night stay instead.
After looking around in the village, I realize that it's right on the "hot spot".
I head back to the source of the music.
Everyone is gathered on the town hall square, where a small stage and microphone have been set up.
There's quite the crowd (considering the size of the village), around 50 people.

There are two musicians, each with a microphone and a guitar.
They play very French hits, mixed in with some jokes.
People look really happy and sing along a bit.
It's simple, but _the cultural offer_ is probably not very wide around here (that's a euphemism), hence the crowd. 
I grab a beer and briefly enjoy the even, before heading to the gîte, whose entrance is right next to the musicians.

I was told by the person running the café, who also runs the gîte, that I'll be sleeping on my own once again.
The atmosphere is very different this time around though, with all the people in the street, the music and the atmosphere on the town square.
I thus prepare dinner in this friendly, festive atmosphere.

After the music stops, around 22:00, it all becomes much quieter and I can go to sleep in silence.
