Given how much food I have left, I can hardly eat anything this morning.
My minuscule breakfast eaten, I set off on the trail.
The first goal is to climb back up to the Limon plateau I left yesterday.
My consolation prize is that this must be the first hiking morning where the weather is really nice.
I haven't seen the sun rise in my entire trip.
It's not that I wasn't up early enough, the sun was always hidden by thick clouds. 
Looking up, it seems that this situation is not meant to last.
It may be sunny now, but the clouds are low and seem to flirt with the plateau I'm heading towards.
Maybe they cover it completely.
I can't say from here.

While I'm busy contemplating the weather ahead, a family of farmers passes me in a tractor and pick-up truck.
They lead cows from one plot to another.
I'm particularly impressed by the teenage girl who's with them.
She can't be older than 16 years old, but she's in no way afraid of the animals, which must be 10 times her size.
She pushes them, taps them lightly with an electric cane, and doesn't hesitate to stand right in front of them, arms stretched out, to stop them going the wrong way.
These impressive practical skills of hers are quickly overshadowed by the thought that they have been developed at the cost of underage unpaid work, which reduced the time dedicated to the child's personal and academic development.
Nothing is ever simple.

Back on the plateau, the weather is exactly as it seemed from below.
Foggy, damp, windy and cold.
This unpleasant weather remains constant throughout the entire morning.

As on other days, I pass absolutely no one on the trail all morning, except for a woman in the mist from a distance.
To be more accurate, I saw a moving humanoid form in the mist from afar, which I associated with a woman.
The "encounter" is rather mystical.

To make matters worse, nature itself seems to refuse to show itself in this weather.
I come across absolutely no animals.
No cows, no sparrows, no birds of prey, no rodents, no insects.
I can't hear any birds singing or chirping.
Only the occasional gust of wind breaks this heavy silence.
My sense of sight is not much more stimulated than my hearing.
The fog is thick and I can hardly see a thing.

To fend off boredom, I use the posts regularly placed along the edge of the meadow next to me to measure my field of vision.
I start by measuring the distance between two posts in steps, convert this value into meters, then use it to measure my field of vision by counting the number of posts I see in front of me.
This distance varies between 20 and 50 metres, depending on the wind.

When my field of vision clears a bit at times, the fog gives way to beautiful landscapes which, with the light, dew and mist constantly in the background, remind me very much of Ireland or Scotland.
The stone cairns that I follow, showing me the path forward, contribute to the formation of these Druidic views.

In this cold, wet weather, I thank the wary and thoughtful me who decided to pack all these clothes a little over a week ago.
The gloves, headband and jacket really aren't superfluous right now.

The same me from the past seems to have been much worse at managing food.
As I mentioned yesterday, I got almost nothing left to eat.
So little, in fact, that I ate almost nothing this morning before leaving the lodge.
After walking all morning, I'm getting hungrier and hungrier.
I stop every now and then to briefly snack on the only thing I've got left, Swedish dry bread.
I have nothing to put on it.
It's a pretty sad snack.

After a few of these short breaks, I also finish this pack of bread.
I've got absolutely nothing left to eat.
This has never happened to me on such hike trips.
I know that I'll reach a place where I'll be able to resupply in a couple hours' walk, but I'm already (and still) hungry.
Combined with the weather conditions, hunger makes walking very unpleasant.

Searching over and over through my backpack, I end up finding a stick of licorice I bought in Sweden.
I bite into it.
I remember eating a few of those as a child.
It clearly tasted better in my memory.
Chewing on something, even if not tasty, has the advantage of tricking my brain into reducing my sense of hunger.

Towards the end of the morning, a shape appears in the mist.
It's a cow.
As I get closer, I can discern the rest of the herd.
The cows lie peacefully on the grass, accompanied by their calves and the bull.
However, they're lying right on the path.
They're in such a compact formation that it wouldn't be reasonable to try and cross the herd, especially under the bull's eye.
I wouldn't want to risk it.
Getting around the herd doesn't seem easy either, since the place where the herd has elected to stay forms a small summit surrounded by very steep grassy slopes.

Without a real choice, I engage on the slippery slopes in an attempt to go around the group of ruminants.
I remain vigilant, as I can't truly stay far away from the calves, and I sometimes slip, which could scare them off.
But all goes well.

And then, as soon as I pass this obstacle, everything changes.
The view finally opens up.
I've reached the end of the fog.
I can now see for miles ahead.

The sudden appearance of the sun warms and invigorates me.
It's at times like this that I really realize the impact of the weather on my mood.

Now that I can see, I search with my eyes the path that I'll be following today.
It's easy to see the valley below, its slopes rising steeply to the Puy Mary, the summit of the day.
Following the ridge to its left, I see what appears to be a hole in the ridge.
It's hard to get a good idea of the nature and size of the hole from here, but it's clearly visible.

It's at that time that I remember the words of the 3 women I met yesterday.
They were talking about the Brèche de Roland (_Roland's Breach_).
Before going themselves, they had heard just about everything about this passage.
Some say it's very aerial and dangerous, others that it's not much harder than a normal trail.
Even after doing it themselves, they didn't all agree on what to make of it.
But they did seem to indicate that it wasn't all that difficult.

Wary, I check my map to see if there is an alternative route, in case I don't feel up to it when the time comes.
Nothing simple is apparent on the map.
With my eyes fixed on the future obstacle, I continue on my way towards the summit.

I arrive at the pass below the Puy Mary, before beginning the ascent.
The shop-cafeteria that I find here really acts as an oasis in the middle of the desert for me.
I'm very relieved to find that it's really open, as was planned.
I can enjoy a hot meal after the humidity and constant cold of the morning.
I also replenish my food supplies, which had been reduced to a single partially-chewed stick of licorice.

Since reaching this pass, I really feel like I've returned to civilization.
Cars pass on the road.
I've seen people, and even had to talk to some of them.
On the path, I pass other hikers, whose numbers increase as I move forward.
Even though I'm following the GR, a well-known long-distance footpath (_in France_), I can really feel the difference between the sections close to popular points of interest (like the summits) and the sections between them, where I meet absolutely no one.

The crowd reaches its peak when I reach the last point accessible by car before the summit.
From here begins a long sequence of stairs leading to the summit of Puy Mary.
Before setting off, I look at my phone to get an idea of what time it is.
That's when I see 3 missed calls from my mom.
Immediately, I start to think about what could be so urgent that she needs to call me so many times, when she knows that I'm hiking all day.
The darkest scenarios form as I try to listen to the messages on my answering machine.

After a few minutes filled with anxiety, I understand that it wasn't anything serious.
She was just wondering if we could see each other, as she was driving past the Puy de Dôme.
This is the place I left 6 days ago.
Although I'm on foot and not moving extremely fast, I've put quite some distance between me and the Puy de Dôme since then.

This brief moment of stress behind me, I start the climb up the stairs, decided to reach the summit.
The other people ascending to the top are doing so in a wide variety of conditions.
Some are carrying much bigger backpacks than I do, while others carry nothing at all.
Some have very good hiking shoes, others wear sandals.
Some overtake me by climbing the steps four at a time, others have to stop multiple times during the climb.
Although I sometimes find it frustrating to walk a long, arduous way to the top of a mountain, only to be surrounded by people who only had to walk 100 metres to get there from the parking lot, I don't get that impression here at all.
Everyone seems respectful of the effort involved, and most seem to have some hiking experience.
In these conditions, I find it even more pleasant to be surrounded by a wide variety of people rather than only hardcore mountain folks.

When I arrive at the summit, I get lucky and can benefit from an opening in the uneven layer of clouds.
The sky remains low, but I can see quite far.
It's a proper 360° panorama.
Among the various peaks covered in green grass, a grey cone stands out.
I check the direction...
It's definitely in the direction of the Plomb du Cantal, but the isolated cone topography disqualifies it from being the coveted summit.
At least, according to my reading of the map.
It's actually the Puy Griou, which I won't pass by.

With the help of a passerby, I manage to correctly identify my ultimate goal: the Plomb du Cantal.
You can hardly tell that it's a summit, as it blends so much into the mass of the long ridge it belongs to.
It's totally undistinguishable, perfectly dull.
It really doesn't look like the highest point in the Massif Central.
But it's clear that I'm getting close to my goal.

On the other side, towards the north, info points give the overall direction of the Puy de Dôme and the Puy de Sancy.
The former is too far away to see today.
I honestly don't know whether it's really visible in perfectly clear weather, as it is really far.
Today, we can only vaguely guess the latter.

It doesn't excite me as much as I thought it would to think that I've walked all the way from those faraway peaks in the distance.
It's almost more impressive to see where I started from this morning, which already seems so far away.
Perhaps this distance seems more _palpable_, more realistic, as I can almost see the entire route I've travelled.

Turning around literally takes me from the past to the future.
From the platform I stand on, on the opposite side of the road I've travelled, lies the road still to be travelled.

I look for the exact route I'll be on for the rest of the day.
It's a beautiful ridge path.
I'm particularly interested in the Brèche de Roland, as I'm still unsure about crossing this precise point, given the extra weight I'm carrying.
Unfortunately, I can't see it from here.
I then try to follow the trail with my eyes all the way to the end to estimate where the evening's gîte is.
Hidden by the mountains in the foreground, it doesn't seem so far away compared to where I started this morning.

<p style="color:gray;" align="center"> <i> In the foreground, the ridge path. Behind it, Puy Griou. In the background, Plomb du Cantal. </i> </p>

While I'm going down, I keep thinking about the Brèche de Roland.
Signs scattered along the way describe it as a challenging passage, and indicate that an alternative path exists.
Once I get there, it's not that impressive.
You have to use your hands a little, but this kind of very steep passage over a few meters is quite common in the Alps.
Nothing special to report here.
However, it is interesting to note that this passage, which isn't all that technical, and doesn't seem particularly long or high, is so easily seen from a distance.
When I came into sight of the breach around midday, it was very impressive, forming a large hole in the rocky terrain.
I guess that was just the effect of perspective.

After that, there isn't much worth reporting until I arrive at the Super Lioran resort.
The resort is deserted and sad, like all winter resorts outside of the snowy season.

As I arrive, I realize that today's hike wasn't as exhausting as expected.
According to the measurements on my itinerary, it was supposed to be the day with the most elevation and one of the longest distance of the trip.
But I don't feel that tired.
At least, not particularly more than on previous days, considering the 25 km I put behind me.

The end of the hike signals that I'm reaching the gîte for the night.
It's a pleasant surprise this time, but somehow I had a very specific idea of the place in mind when I booked, and this _a priori_ doesn't correspond at all to the reality.
I don't know why, but the housing's website made me think of a house run by one or more old ladies with a cosy / lace / fireplace kind of atmosphere.
As it turns out, it's more of a pub kind of atmosphere, and the place is run by a couple of trendy thirty year olds.
It doesn't change anything, and it's even for the better, but I'd be curious to go back to the website and try to understand what could have given me this impression.

I'm looking forward to tomorrow's hiking day.
I'll reach the ultimate goal of this trip.
