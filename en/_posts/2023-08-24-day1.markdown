On the morning of the first day, I take the bus to Vulcania, which takes me out of the city of Clermont-Ferrand.
Vulcania park will be the starting point for my hiking journey.

It's very hot at the start of the walk: 33°C.
I'm glad that I packed 3 liters of water.
It is a bit cooler here than in Clermont-Ferrand, due to the difference in altitude.
The temperature must be around 40°C in Clermont-Ferrand.

I leave a little later than planned: 10:30 rather than 10:00.
Initially scheduled for 4:30 p.m., the estimated time of arrival shifts to 5 p.m.

Despite the heat, most of the route takes place in the forest, making the temperature bearable.
The ascent to Puy de Dôme, on the other hand, takes place fully in the open, under a blazing sun.
Not a cloud in sight to dampen the sun's rays.
The climb is a little more difficult because of it, but not excessively so.

At the summit, it's very crowded.
During the climb, the closer I got to the summit, the more people I encountered on the path.
These hikers were mainly going in the opposite direction, i.e. down the puy.
As I understand it, a lot of people take the cable car up to the summit, then walk back down to their car.

Apart from the crowd, what I notice is the time I arrived at the summit: 1pm.
I originally planned to get there by 11:30am, a time already shifted to 12:00 with my late departure.
This delay makes me worried a bit.
An hour's difference is not to be taken lightly.
Especially as I didn't really take a break on the way up.
I'll have to keep an eye on the watch this afternoon.

While computing new estimates for this evening's time of arrival, I decide to walk around the summit.
It's so vast that it's impossible to see everything around from a single vantage point.
Nevertheless, the various observation posts provide a 360° panorama _via_ recomposed images.  
The various puys around Puy de Dôme are clearly visible.
The shape of the Puy Pariou, in particular, is a clear testament to its past volcanic activity.

On the other side, towards the south, you can see in the distance the peaks I'll be climbing over the next few days: Puy de Sancy, Puy Mary, Plomb du Cantal.
I can also make out the village where I'll be spending the night.
The sight makes me anxious, it seems so far away.

Once back down the Puy, I'm quite tired.
I know from the initial signs that I've only covered 7 km since leaving this morning.
So I decide to push on to the next village, Laschamps, without taking a break.
By the time I get there, I'm exhausted.
My shoulders hurt, my legs hurt, my feet hurt.
I open the map, hoping it will tell me that there are only a few kilometers left.
There are 13 left.
I've only done 10.
I'm not even halfway through.

This moment is very hard for my morale.
It makes me doubt that I'll make it to Saint-Flour.
The idea that the pain I'm feeling and the fatigue I'm experiencing are just the beginning of the journey doesn't reassure me at all.
The thought that these 2 elements are only going to accumulate over the next few days almost kills my determination.
Nevertheless, I decide to make a big effort, and at least complete this first day.
I can always decide tomorrow what to do.

It's a very difficult decision.
Thinking about how much it already hurts, how tired I am and the fact that I still have to cover a longer distance than what I have done so far to get to tonight's accommodation forms a mental barrier that's hard to overcome.

The desire to test a complete day of walking, to get a better idea of what awaits me for the next few days, and the frustration of giving up so early are the strongest, and I manage to get moving again, but with a change of strategy.
Rather than moving forward "chilling", stopping to observe every insect, every spider, every pretty flower and taking a photo at every vantage point, I must cover distance.
The aim is really to rack up the kilometers.
To this end, I only allow myself one break in the 4 hours of walking that remain.

Because yes, it's 4 hours of walking that remain.
I covered 10 km in 3h15, so my hourly average is closer to 3 km than to the 4 I had forecast.
This difference of 3 to 4 km/h, which seems small at first glance, means that it will take me 8 h to complete the 23 km of today's route, rather than the expected 6 h at 4 km/h.
My estimated time of arrival therefore shifts from 4:30 pm (quite optimistic initially), to 7-8 pm.
If I want to get there before sunset, I have no choice but to cover ground.
I have to walk in order to eat up the kilometers and nothing else.

From the Puy-de-Dôme, I had observed the route I have to follow.
With the help of the map, I know that the route I'm following winds between the puys, which are sometimes to my left, sometimes to my right.
Now that I'm walking in the forest, I would have no idea that this is the case.
The forest is the forest and you can't see far in any direction.
I tell myself that you can sometimes be on an exceptional site, but be completely incapable of realizing it if you don't have a clear field of vision.

A little further into the forest, another thought pops into my head.
I may have walked mostly in the forest, but the atmosphere was very different each time.
I walked through forests of oaks, birches, conifers.
The light also changed, which had an impact on the atmosphere of the place.
I always thought that I wasn't a big fan of the forest, but I really enjoyed the different atmospheres and took quite a few photos.

The fact that the area was volcanic also becomes obvious a little further on.
The stones on the ground, dark and porous, are obviously of volcanic origin.

At last, I reach the crossroads where I allowed myself a break.
It's just below the Puy de la Vache.
I'm exhausted, but not much more so than at Laschamps.
That's a good sign.
I've still got between 1h30 and 2h to walk to Vernines.
As long as my morale holds, I'll be fine.

The trail passes under the main road, then along a path in the middle of fields.
I left the main GR route to reach Vernines.
I'm now at the mercy of my map reading, as the path I'm taking is not marked, but is indicated on the map.

Many argiopes (_Argiope bruennichi_) have woven their webs along the edges of the path.
I love this spider so much that I allow myself to stop and observe them.

I then realize that the landscape around me, which I've been passing through and photographed furtively this afternoon, really is a postcard of the French countryside.
Rolling hills, covered with meadows where cows graze, interspersed with wooded areas over which buzzards soar, all criss-crossed by a few small, lightly-travelled departmental roads.
It really does sound like the ideal of the peaceful countryside we're sold as a place to spend our vacations to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life.
I wonder what other départements could be so close to this ideal.
Meuse perhaps?

The last 3 kilometers along the main road seem endless.
At the end of these, I finally arrive at the accommodation, just before 8pm.
The "whole gîte" I've rented is in fact an apartment in a small single-storey building.
The tourists staying in the apartment next to mine, when they see me arrive, are very surprised that I'm on foot.
When they hear that I haven't eaten yet, they rush to offer me tomatoes from their own garden.
How nice of them.

It's the end of a long day.  
Will I continue tomorrow?
