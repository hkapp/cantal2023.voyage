I'm on the bus to Clermont-Ferrand, the starting point for my adventure.
During the journey, I check the weather conditions for the first days of my journey.
After the hot weather in Annecy, where I've been until now, I'm starting to worry about walking in extreme heat.
Today's forecast in Clermont-Ferrand is 37°C.
Orange and red heatwave alerts in almost all surrounding departments.
All departments to the east of the Puy-de-Dôme (63) and Cantal (15), where I'll be walking, are on red alert.
It's not very reassuring.

When arriving in Clermont-Ferrand, the temperature is reasonable.
It's hot, but livable.
The light breeze blowing at regular intervals helps a lot.

I start by putting my things down at the youth hostel before taking a stroll around town.
When I arrive at the hostel, the room is like an oven.
Or rather a steam room, considering the humidity.
If staying outside is perfectly acceptable, in this cell I'm sweating without even moving.
I hurry out of the place, hoping the temperature will drop by the time I get back.
The 2 roommates who knowingly stay in this oven must really be suffering.
Well, not necessarily, as one of them is fast asleep.

The city is dirty.
At least, that's the impression I get from the street leading from the station to the city center.
I get exactly the same impression as the district surrounding the train station in Marseille.
A neighborhood from another time, another place.
Faded or broken shop windows, jumbled merchandise in the street, idle youngsters hanging around.
The stores on the first floor of the buildings are out of shape.
The windows of some are obscured by curtains and large cardboard boxes, while others make it clear from the outside that they are perfectly empty and seem abandoned.
Others are so full that it seems difficult to open the door.
The glares of the locals and the general atmosphere don't make me feel welcome.

A few discreet churches dot the path to the cathedral in the center of town.
The café terraces that appear as I approach the historical centre make me feel more at ease, even if I can sense the hypocrisy of this "white guy safe space".

By the time I decide to return to the youth hostel, the temperature outside has dropped considerably.
I enter the room.
It's the same temperature as when I left a few hours ago.
By the time I've emptied my bag, I'm already sweating profusely.
I climb into the bunk bed (I sleep upstairs).
The temperature is such that, lying in bed, I continue to sweat.
Impossible to fall asleep.
After an hour or two of tossing and turning, I decide to get some fresh air.
I open the door and step outside onto the landing.
The temperature here is so pleasant.
Just one step outside the den in which I'm supposed to be sleeping.
The temperature difference between inside and outside is enormous.
At least 5°, maybe 10.
The humidity in the room isn't helping.
And it's impossible to improve the situation by letting fresh air into the dormitory: the only window is too narrow and the air doesn't circulate.
I wonder if leaving the door open would allow some air circulation, but after 10 minutes on the doorstep without noticing any change, I abandon this plan.

I go back upstairs to bed, where the temperature is even higher and the air feels imprisoned.
I lie down in the already sweat-soaked sheets without finding sleep.
I'm not the only one struggling, but others have succeeded and let us know loudly.
Snoring sounds don't help relaxing and falling asleep.

After 1 a.m., I try a radical approach.
I take my pillow and try to sleep outside on the ground.
The rough concrete slab is more comfortable than it first appears.
Still, it's very hard.
The temperature is much more pleasant, but the noise of the street, my inability to find a comfortable position and my unfortunate position, right under an outside lamp that comes on automatically every 5 minutes, don't allow me to fall asleep.
After half an hour, without success, I return to my bed, hoping that the temperature will have cooled.
It hasn't.

At around 02:30, I try the outside again.
But this time, based on my previous experience, I take along a sleeping mask to combat the lamp, and earplugs to combat the street noise.
I even take advantage of the elongated shape of my pillow to put as much of my body weight on it as possible and thus combat the hardness of the ground.
This second attempt is a success.
I end up falling into the arms of Morpheus.
I wake up later at around 05:30 and end the night in my own bed.

What a good night's sleep to start walking for over a week...
