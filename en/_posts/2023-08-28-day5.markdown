As I get going this morning, I come across a few people.
It's obviously much quieter than last night.
In particular, a couple of elderly hikers emerge from the fog next to the village's church.

They're looking for the GR trail, going in the same direction as me.
In fact, they're heading for the same place, as their walking day also ends in Dienne, where they'll be spending the night at the gîte d'étape.
For the moment, they're just waiting for the rest of their group, 7 people in total.
We'll probably meet up again later in the day, as we're following the same route.
I thus leave them with a wave.

As I'm about to leave the village, I stop for a moment to enjoy the view.
The atmosphere is a little mysterious, in the mist once more, though it's not as thick as the previous days. 
The scene could be drawn as follows.  
In the foreground, a beautiful draft horse.
Behind it, two large mansions.
And in the background, the rolling Cantal countryside, with its farm buildings scattered here and there.

An information panel tells me that one of the 2 mansions is a castle that has been in the d'Estaing family for a long time.
I wonder if this is the line to which VGE belongs (_a French president from the 70's_).
If so, it only confirms that power structures never really change.
Today's leaders are the same as they were 200 years ago.

This morning is all about fog and road.
With no footpath going in the right direction to trace the GR, I'll be walking on communal roads for most of the day.  
The fog isn't very thick (you can see for 100-150m), but it wets everything, including me.
This humidity is making me very cold.
When leaving, I was wondering whether I packed too many clothes for a summer trip.
I'm now wearing all my warm clothes, which includes my sweater and jacket, as well as a warm hat and gloves (worn intermittently).

All of this is taking a toll on my morale.
Between the lack of view and the weather conditions, I'm not having much fun.
To compensate, I decide to stop at the next village and try to find an open café to order a hot chocolate.
This should warm me up and raise my motivation level.
The stop is all the more important as there won't be another village or hamlet until the end of the hike in Dienne.
So this is also my only opportunity to sit in the warmth.
However, I also try to manage my expectations in order not to be too disappointed if the village in question doesn't have anything open, which, considering how things went the previous days, is quite likely.

![Unattended communal road]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/IMG_1693216642.jpg)

Luckily, there is a café open in Saint-Saturnin (15).
The place is a flagrant reflection of the lack of investment and dynamism in these very rural parts of France.  
A white PVC door with only one side open leads to a room paved with white tiles.
The bar has evidently been cut by an amateur, quickly sanded but not varnished.
In the rest of the room, small wobbly tables are surrounded by old school chairs.
Three regular customers sit in different corners, no one uttering a word.
The owner is currently missing in the picture.

With no one to order from, the silence of 4 people quickly becomes unbearable.
After a few minutes however, the barkeeper enters through the main door.
I feel a bit silly asking for a hot chocolate when some people are already drinking wine and beer, but a lady before me does the same. 

After a while, another woman comes in.
The small-town atmosphere is reinforced when she announces that she's coming from the post office (which also happens to be the town hall) with mail for some of the regulars.

The woman's face looks familiar.
I think about where I might have seen her.
She recognized me too, so I'm not making this up.  
She was the only person I'd met in Lugarde this morning, apart from the couple of old hikers.

Since the woman in question obviously lives in Lugarde, I deduce from her announcement that all services have disappeared in Lugarde, and that the inhabitants have to come all the way here, a few kilometers away, simply to receive their mail.

After distributing the mail, she starts talking about last night's party.
It was the village's annual gathering, and the mayor's office apparently blew the budget (literally) over 3 days, with fireworks on day 2.
The lottery also had surprising results (at least to me).
Most of the prizes went to people that don't live in the village.

I can understand that parties like this must attract people, as distractions must be rare around here.
However, I find it odd that a number of these prizes went to people who don't even live in the region, for example in Normandy.
That's when I'm told that many of the houses in the surrounding villages are in fact vacation houses.
According to those present, about half the houses in the area are secondary homes.
In fact, this is the season when people who don't live here year-round start to return home.
In a month or two, the population will have been reduced by half, and the average age will have greatly increased.

I would have initially thought that the permanent residents of the village would have a some form of animosity towards this large proportion of holiday residents.
It doesn't seem to be the case.  
The way they talk about it, it sounds more like resignation.
The acceptance of a sad reality: without these part-time residents, these villages would only decline more rapidly.
This influx of life, even if it is temporary and somewhat artificial, enables them to maintain minimal local services, shops and transportation.
There's actually a lot of good will in their attempt to find a replacement prize for someone who lives in Brittany but has won a voucher for a local shop. 

Before she leaves, the woman I met earlier offers to pay for the drink of the man who's been leaning against the bar since I arrived.
It's only 10am, but he's already drinking white wine.
And at his 2nd glass, at least since I'm here.
The man's name is Chirac, reminiscent of the character in the movie "Camping" and this line: "Why should I be the one to change my name?" (_Note: that's a very French reference_).
Having read somewhere that many French presidents come from the Cantal region, which seemed fitting considering the discovery of the d'Estaing castle earlier in the day, I thought at this time that this man could be related to the former (and now deceased) president.
A later Internet search will disprove all of this, as Chirac was born and raised in Paris (and VGE was born in Koblenz, Germany).

It's my turn to leave.
The whole time I was here, I was always throwing glances outside.
I was expecting the old couple and their group of 7 to pass by at any moment.
Since they're following the GR and going to the same place as me, they're bound to pass through here.
I actually extended my stay a bit to see how much of a head start I had on them.
But nobody came by.

As I leave the café, however, I see them coming down from the upper part of the village.
I came this way about half an hour ago.
If they needed 30 minutes more than me to do what is effectively a 1h30 hiking section, I fear they'll arrive quite late in Dienne.
I say hi from afar and continue walking.

![Not really motivated to fly]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/IMG_1693221154.jpg)

The path that follows this long break runs along a communal road.
It's in pretty poor condition, cracked and full of holes, despite the few cars that seem to pass this way.
The uninteresting path I follow, combined with the consistently cold, wet, windy and view-obstructing weather conditions, doesn't make this section very fun.

The only thing that makes this section remotely interesting is the presence of birds of prey, which I can get close to without much difficulty.
Probably due to the fog, these birds don't seem very motivated to fly.
This means that when I get close, they don't immediately fly away.
This allows me to observe them quite closely, and take a couple of nice pictures.
Perhaps for the same reason, they seem to prefer to stay on the ground rather than on tree branches, which works in my favor here.

Along the road, the map shows a castle.
A large historic building would break the monotony of this boring stretch of road.
However, I must not have the same definition of the word "castle", as the building in question, although large, is today a farmhouse with no distinctive features.
Emerging from the fog, the building did have a slightly mysterious feel about it, but only from a distance.

As I walk along the road, I pass absolutely no one.
No walkers, no locals, no cyclists.
The passage of 3 cars in 2 hours is the only guarantee that human civilization hasn't collapsed over the course of my journey.

In this wet and windy weather, finding a reasonable place to eat is not easy.
The total lack of any hamlets or villages makes the task even harder.
Without conviction, I sit down on the ground by the side of the road, only a few metres away from where the main road crosses my communal road.
Not the most bucolic spot ever.
I shorten this unfun time by quickly eating the little food I have left, before setting off into the fog once more.

The path now looks more like a gravel road than a traditional one, which is the only noticeable improvement about my walking conditions.
To make this unpleasant hike as short as possible, I hardly take any breaks.
I hope to arrive as soon as possible, sit down and get warm.

In the early afternoon, the cloud cover rises slightly.
Instead of being constantly in the fog, clouds now regularly fly over me.
The weather is still very gloomy, but my field of vision now exceeds 50 metres, sometimes even 200 metres.
The situation gradually improves over time, the clouds remaining low but rarely reaching down to my level.

This increase in my field of vision allows me to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Limon plateau.
This is a huge plateau at an altitude of 1,200 metres above sea level.

There are no year-round houses on the plateau.
The only buildings are _burons_, historically used for cheese production.
Almost the entire surface of the plateau is dedicated to cow grazing.

This gigantic continuous grazing area, although shared between several farmers, means that each farm has huge pieces of land mainly in single blocks.
The path I walk on is surrounded by fences marking the edge of a meadow on either side, but wherever I look I am totally unable to see the fence indicating the end of the meadow.
These grassy spaces seem endless.
Although quite hilly, these large continuous spaces dedicated to agriculture matches the image I have of the American midwest.

The surfaces are so vast that, although the whole plateau is dedicated to cows, I see very few of them.
The few herds I see form small dots in the distance.

![Ireland?]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/IMG_1693228573.jpg)

Towards the end of the day, I see the _gendarme's cross_ in the distance.
This indicates the point where I have to leave the GR and the plateau, to descend towards Dienne, where my accommodation for the night is located.
To get there, I have to cross a fairly large herd of cows.
Nothing I haven't done before.

As I pass the last of the ruminants and lift the gate to leave the field, a woman calls out to me.
She's quickly joined by 2 others.

The first person saw me go through the herd and starts asking me how one is supposed to cross herds like that safely.
Given the context, I'm sure that she saw me pass through it without following some of the usual rules and wants to correct me.
I therefore list all the rules I know, plus what seems like common sense to me.

She actually had no intention of correcting me.
With her friends they planned to follow that very path in the opposite direction in the morning, but they didn't dare cross the herd and found an alternative path instead.
She simply wanted to know what they were supposed to do in such circumstances.
Looks like I was being overly defensive.

We make our way down the windy plateau together, which I'm happy about, given my lack of social interaction over the last few days.
On the way down, they tell me how they've managed to keep their group of friends together over the years, even though they've all followed quite different paths in life.
They also manage to guess quite easily the kind of job position I hold, as well as my level of education, based on "the type of journey I'm undertaking".

<p style="color:gray;" align="center"> <i> Up next tomorrow: the Puy Mary, currently with its head stuck in the clouds </i> </p>

On the topic of food stocks, I counted on Dienne to refill my supplies.
Once I'm there, I start to walk around the village to find a place where I can buy what I need.
The arrival of a bus full of tourists (average age 80 y/o) makes me quite confident that there has to be a suitable store here.  
However, the bakery and snack bar I pass by are closed, and have been for a long time.
My phone tells me that there is a grocery store here.
When I get there, it turns out to be a restaurant called "L'Épicerie" (_note: in French, grocery store can be translated as "épicerie"_).
I've been had.
This place is even closed today.
Totally pointless.
The people at the town hall also confirm that there's no such thing here.

Feeling a bit stressed, I head back to the gîte to try and find a solution.
I still have enough to eat tonight, but clearly not enough to eat tomorrow morning nor lunch.  
Both my paper map and Google Maps agree that there should be food _en route_ tomorrow.
However, I can't help thinking about the scenario where they're all closed.

Shortly thereafter, the first people from the large group I met earlier today arrive at the gîte.
It took them a bit more than 2 hours more than me.  
Over dinner, one of them tells me tales from his mountaineering life.
Many of the situations he describes seem extremely dangerous and stressful to me.
I was already not so motivated by this activity, and I think I'm even less so now.

Fortunately for me, no mountaineering is planned for the next few days.
Just walking.
