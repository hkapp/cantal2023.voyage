Like every other day, I start walking around 8:30 am, even though the initial target is usually 8:00 am.
This time difference is even less important than usual, as today's hike presents no particular difficulties: no elevation, and no more kilometers than other days.
There's also less motivation since, as was mentioned yesterday, the goal has already been reached.
There's no real goal now other than reaching the final destination.
The route doesn't seem particularly interesting either.
Basically, I'm walking with the sole aim of reaching Saint Flour, nothing else.  
The bright sunshine at least makes the journey pleasant.

I mainly follow the road, surrounded as always by cow meadows.
Similarly to the beginning of my journey, the calves are curious, but always get frightened at the last moment.
One would think that the barrier between us would make them feel safer and thus more reckless, but that's not the case at all.
If I ever get too close to the fence, they get startled and run away in panic.
Then they turn around, observe me, then slowly come towards me until the cycle starts all over again.
I spend some time playing with them this way, these young bovines being the only company I can enjoy this morning.

Vis-à-vis the calf meadow, on the other side of the road, I observe a truly strange event.
A cow (yes, I'm really sure it's a cow) is trying to ride another.
Her partner remains perfectly unphased.
What I can't figure out is what the other cow is trying to accomplish.
Every time the one below moves to get out of the way, the other one tries again.
This whole processed gets repeated a few times, until the nonconsensual participant properly moves away, probably passably annoyed.
Still, what did the other cow expect?
Given the anatomy of the animals, nothing could really have happened there.
I'm a bit confused.

<p style="color:gray;" align="center"> <i> The Plomb du Cantal (in the middle) properly hides the Massif Central </i> </p>

Most of today's route consistently remains around a village that is slightly higher than the rest of the plain.
It provides a visual anchor and a landmark for my navigation.
The path continues along the road.
As I pass the various farm buildings next to it, most of the guard dogs bark at me.
In these situations, I'm not always very confident.
Especially when the dogs get really close to me.
But I don't really have a choice, I must go this way.
In any case, stopping and showing hesitation or doubt would only increase their audacity.
Farmers sometimes pass by with their tractors, but none of them say anything to their dogs.

As the buildings are quite far apart (to put it mildly), I often have a clear field of vision.
I regularly take the opportunity to look back, where I see the Plomb du Cantal slowly receding into the distance.
The summit seems to reign supreme over these sun burnt plains, being the only peak visible from here, hiding behind it the entirety of the Massif Central.
In the other direction, the Cévennes seem like a blue mirage that becomes more real as I move further away from the mountains that have seen me pass.

With no goal other than reaching my final destination, and walking along a rather uninteresting path, I cover distance at a very fast pace, arriving in Saint-Flour around 4pm.
The sub-prefecture forms my finishing line.

After walking 180 km in 8 days, I'll take the bus back to Clermont-Ferrand tomorrow morning.
For me, this is the end.

# Epilogue - Returning to civilization

After crossing the finish line, I've got to get back to civilization.

This change of paradigm is materialized by the bus that takes me back to Clermont-Ferrand.
It takes the bus two hours to cover the distance it took me 8 days to walk.

Through the window, I can retrace my steps backwards.
As I pass in front of all the peaks I've climbed over the week, I already feel a slight whiff of nostalgia.

Once in the city, it seems I'm not quite ready to rejoin society.
Since my arrival in Clermont-Ferrand, there have been people everywhere.
Far more than I've encountered over the last few days.
I instinctively avoid these crowds and prefer to find a quiet spot in a park.
What drives me most to spend the afternoon in this park, fast reading my book in the shade of the pines, surrounded by squirrels?
The call of nature, like a mistress I seem to already be cheating on; or the complete lack of desire to do anything, everything seeming futile now that my journey has come to an end?

When I have to pee, and mechanically consider the few bushes in this populated park in the middle of the city as an appropriate infrastructure, I understand that I'll need some time to get back into the mold of social conventions.
