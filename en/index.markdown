Welcome to my blog!

This is a writeup of my hiking adventure in French Massif Central in August 2023.
I followed the GR4 between Clermont-Ferrand and Saint-Flour,
passing by the Puy de Dôme, Puy de Sancy, Puy Mary and finally, the Plomb du Cantal,
for a total of 180km over 8 days.

This trip was inspired by Patrick Süskind's novel _The Perfume_.
In that book, the main character undertakes a journey from Paris to Grasse, all on foot.
Trying to avoid mankind, he stops along the way at Plomb du Cantal, and ends up staying there for several years, as it is "the furthest place from civilization one can find".  
Curious to visit France's last major mountainous area I haven't been to yet, and wanting to go on a week-long hiking trip, I organized this tour with the goal of arriving at the Plomb du Cantal last, as the key highlight of my stay.
Of course, I didn't do the whole trip from Paris to Grasse, but I did try to arrive from the north, like the character, following the GR4 (not like the character).

There is one blog entry per hiking day.
Enjoy!
