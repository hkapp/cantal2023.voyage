Welcome to my blog!

This is a writeup of my hiking adventure in French Massif Central in August 2023.
I followed the GR4 between Clermont-Ferrand and Saint-Flour,
passing by the Puy de DÃ´me, Puy de Sancy, Puy Mary and finally, the Plomb du Cantal,
for a total of 180km over 8 days.

There will be one blog entry per hiking day.
If they're not all available, come back in a couple of days, there might be more ;)
